        An excuse to draw Sankey diagrams and learn to do aggregations in Elasticsearch. The Enron mail corpus fit and was plenty less trendy than twitter/facebook feeds.

            The tarball of data needed loading into <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a>. I used <a href="https://github.com/andris9/mailparser">mailparser</a> in processing each file to generate an Elasticsearch entry demultiplexing multiple names on the <i>To:</i> line.
    </p>
    <p>        
    <pre>node mail.to.es.js .../enron/enron_mail_20110402/maildir/crandell-s/inbox/2. </pre>
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    That took half a second to load the single mbox-format mail and generate forty-one documents in Elasticsearch (a sample with a long <i>To:</i> list). With half a million files the machine was left running while I floored the loft over a weekend. There's a lot of fat left on that pork chop to speed it up. In the end there are 3.1m documents in the Elasticsearch index.
    </div>
    <p>
    The simple, first Sankey aggregations I wanted was the bowtie as in the image above. This would effectively be the pair:
    </p>
<pre>SELECT 'FROM', COUNT(*) AS C WHERE 'TO'='mike.mcconnell' FROM ENRONMAIL GROUP BY 'FROM' ORDER BY C DESC;
SELECT 'TO', COUNT(*) AS C WHERE 'FROM'='mike.mcconnell' FROM ENRONMAIL GROUP BY 'TO' ORDER BY C DESC;
</pre>
<p>
    Shove that into a basic <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey">Sankey</a> and you're away. I wanted to make the full set and have them navigable by clicking on the sames of the branches to recentre the bowtie. Turns out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30337430/select-event-not-fired-on-google-chart-api-for-sankey">that's not yet possible</a> so I now have two versions -- a clickable list pair of labels with badges to show the counts and the Sankey image.
</p>
    <p>
        I used a modified version of the Sankey generator and iterated it a few times on the list of names it found to build a three-degrees from Rick Buy (or whoever) to build 1826 names to then batch run the lot. Sankeyfying for those names took 2mins 12secs. That's fast enough to do on demand.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    Since these little bowtie Sankey diagrams take less than a tenth of a second each, I want to dial it up a step and go out one branch farther. To have a <i>from:from</i> feed into the <i>from</i> left had side and the mirror on the right. That turns the number of aggregations up from two about the centre name to twenty-two.

        I wanted to learn a little JavaScript and being a non-UI person I did <em>learnyounode</em> until I thought I had enough to start something in anger.</p>

        <a href="http://james-irwin.github.io/fsa/"><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Site</button></a> FSA inspection ratings gathered by county pinned over Google's map.

    <p>
    <a href="http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB"><button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Data</button></a> Food Standards Agency inspection ratings data.
    </p>    
</div>
<div>
<p>
I wanted all the data, and it comes in XML and JSON options. Curl it in batches via
</p>
<p>
    <pre>curl http://ratings.food.gov.uk/search/%5E/%5E/1/5000/xml</pre>
</p> 
<p>
Where <tt>%5E</tt> (^) effectively means a wildcard for both the name of the county and the establishment that was inspected. Replace <tt>xml</tt> with <tt>json</tt> for JSON formatted equivalent. <tt>1</tt> is the page number and <tt>5000</tt> the page size. That's the largest page size I managed to collect -- for a total of about a hundred pages, the result includes metadata with the number of pages at your selected page size. The GitHub repo has an example <a href="https://github.com/james-irwin/fsamap/tree/master/examples">HTML output</a> for just the first 5000 elements.
    
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
Mushing all the FSA inspection data into one large JSON file totals <strong>346Mb</strong>! Throwing away most of that to just pin the location, the rating and the name will make a single file in the tens of megabytes range. Plus node didn't like <tt>fs.readfile()</tt> on a 346Mb file and I didn't have need/care to switch to a streamed implementation. I'm writing my first JavaScript program and didn't want any back-end otherwise I would use elasticsearch and mark the dynamically pulled inspections within the bounds of the Google map.
</div>
</p>
<p>
    As published, the data is partitioned into counties so I scraped the 406 files by curling the <a href = "http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB" >data page</a> and piping it through <tt>grep http://ratings.food.gov.uk/OpenDataFiles/ | grep English</tt> to see something I could use <tt>cut</tt> to strip out the county names and the file names to re-<tt>curl</tt>. The GitHub repo has the <a href="https://github.com/james-irwin/fsamap/tree/master/xmldata">xml data for North Somerset</a> as a snapshot.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers">Google maps with pins are surprisingly simple</a>. After installing <tt>xml2js</tt> to parse the xml with:
<pre>
var xml2js = require('xml2js');
var parser = xml2js.Parser();
parser.parseString(data, function (err, result) {...
</pre>
The inspection set for this county (loaded into <tt>data</tt> via <tt>fs.readFile()</tt>) is now navigable as a JavaScript object.
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
Parsing 406 xml files to put a few thousand pins for the county you're interested in plus 405 <em>jump</em>-pins at appropriate places on the map takes over <strong>three minutes!</strong> on my 2014 MacBook Pro. Scaling that even with the two cores takes about <strong>eight hours</strong> for the set.</div>

I had overnight to let it run rather than do a smarter thing and cache the 406 <em>jump</em>-pins. Then I realised I needed something better anyway...</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
A dozen or so maps wouldn't load, the error console bemoaning <strong>RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded</strong>. Thinking about it, turned out it was because I was simply emitting all the inspections and using <tt>map.panTo(m[0].position)</tt> -- the first marker so that the map was centred over a pin in the county rather than calculate the proper centre of the map first and then emit the cloud of markers. Heed the quality of the data!
</div>
<p>Wanting to avoid re-writing it with a cached set of <em>jump</em>-pins I bulk converted all the <tt>xml</tt> files to <tt>JSON</tt> with <tt>JSON.stringify()</tt> as the body to the callback of the <tt>xml2js::parser.parseString()</tt> function and exchanged the <tt>xml</tt> parser call to a <tt>JSON</tt> parser call (<tt>JSON.parse(data)</tt>). Took only a couple of minutes.
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
Two wins: Firstly, three minutes per county <tt>xml</tt> turned into <strong>seven seconds</strong> per county <tt>JSON</tt> (less than half an hour to do the lot now) and seocndly, skipping inspections that have otherwise <tt>undefined</tt> lat/long data made the browser come alive and all the counties I tried worked.</div>
